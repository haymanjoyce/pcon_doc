## 1. What is Earned Value Management?

Earned Value Management (EVM) is a system of project control based on a structured approach to planning, cost collection, and performance measurement. At its core:

> *"Earned value management is the measurement and monitoring of project progress in terms of cost, time and technical/physical achievement against a defined scope of work."*
> — APM EV Guidelines, p. 6

EVM integrates project scope, time, and cost objectives, and establishes a baseline plan against which performance can be measured throughout project execution. It also provides a sound basis for problem identification, corrective actions, and management replanning.

---

## 2. Core EVM Principles

EVM is built around the following principles (p. 9):

- Defining and authorising the contract scope of work
- Developing a **baseline** against which cost, schedule, and technical performance can be measured
- **Objective performance measurement**
- Variance analysis and corrective action reporting
- Disciplined and timely incorporation of baseline changes

---

## 3. Key Data Elements

Four essential data elements underpin an Earned Value Management System (EVMS) (p. 9):

| Acronym | Plain English | Definition |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **BCWS** (Planned Value, PV) | The Plan | Budgeted cost of work *scheduled* — what we planned to do |
| **BCWP** (Earned Value, EV) | What Was Earned | Budgeted cost of work *performed* — the value of work actually achieved |
| **ACWP** (Actual Cost, AC) | What Was Spent | Actual cost of work *performed* — what the work really cost |
| **EAC** | Estimate at Completion | ACWP to date plus the best estimate of remaining costs |

---

## 4. Performance Measurement: Variances and Indices

Key variances and performance indices are calculated from the three core data elements (pp. 33, 60):

| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Cost Variance (CV)** | BCWP − ACWP | Positive = under budget; Negative = over budget |
| **Schedule Variance (SV)** | BCWP − BCWS | Positive = ahead of schedule; Negative = behind schedule |
| **Cost Performance Index (CPI)** | BCWP ÷ ACWP | >1.0 = efficient; <1.0 = over-spending |
| **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)** | BCWP ÷ BCWS | >1.0 = ahead of schedule; <1.0 = behind schedule |
| **Variance at Completion (VAC)** | BAC − EAC | Expected overrun (negative) or underrun (positive) |

**Variance thresholds** should be established so that only significant variances trigger full analysis and recovery reporting (p. 35).

## 5. Project Structure and Planning

### 5.1 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
A hierarchical subdivision of the project into discrete elements of work. It provides a graphical representation of the Statement of Work (SOW) and continues until the lowest level necessary for management control is reached (p. 14).

### 5.2 Organisation Breakdown Structure (OBS)
A chart defining the organisational structure of the project, clearly setting out roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities for all staff (p. 15).

### 5.3 Control Accounts
The integration of the WBS and OBS produces a **Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM)**. Each cell in the RAM is a **Control Account (CA)** — the main action point for planning and control, with a single Control Account Manager (CAM) responsible for delivery to cost and schedule (p. 15–16).

At the control account level, the following come together:
- Budgets
- Schedules
- Forecasts

### 5.4 Planning Packages and Rolling Wave
Work not yet defined in sufficient detail is captured as **planning packages**. These are progressively converted into **work packages** via *Rolling Wave Planning* as the project matures (p. 56).

---

## 6. Estimates at Completion (EAC)

The EAC is the best estimate of final project cost, based on current performance and realistic assumptions (p. 38):

> **EAC = ACWP (cumulative) + ETC**

Factors to consider when computing the EAC include: past performance, cost and schedule variances, outstanding management actions, anticipated scope changes, future economic conditions, and remaining technical risks.

Common statistical forecasting formulae include (pp. 40, 61):

- `EAC = BAC / CPI` — extrapolates final cost based on current cost efficiency
- `ETC = (BAC – BCWP) / CPI` — cost to complete remaining work
- `Forecast Completion = Original Completion / SPI` — schedule forecasting

---

## 7. Change Management

Authorised changes must be incorporated in a timely manner, with effects recorded in both budgets and schedules. Key requirements (p. 52):

- Reconcile current budgets to prior budgets following any changes
- Control retroactive changes to actual costs, earned value, or budgets
- Prevent unauthorised revisions to the project budget (only Senior Manager or Customer may revise the Contract Budget Base)
- Document all changes to the Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB)

---

## 8. Risk Management

EVM and Risk Management are described as **complementary processes** (p. 43):

> *"The integration of EVM and risk management should provide more realistic earned value assessments and give a better estimate of the project completion cost and timescale."*

- **Risk Management** addresses what *may* happen in the future
- **EVM** uses what *has already happened* to predict and control the future

Integration points include: estimating cost and schedule for risk mitigation activities, establishing the **Management Reserve** budget, and incorporating risk activities into the baseline schedule.

---

## 9. System Review

Three types of system review are identified (p. 45):

1. **Integrated Baseline Review (IBR)** — validates that the Performance Measurement Baseline is realistic and complete
2. **Demonstration Review** — demonstrates that the EVMS meets the required guidelines/criteria
3. **Surveillance** — ongoing monitoring to ensure the system continues to operate effectively

---

## 10. Summary of Benefits

An effective EVMS provides (pp. 6, 9–10):

- Verifiable, objective status reports
- Early warning of cost and schedule problems
- A sound basis for forecasting final cost and completion date
- Accountability in the decision-making process
- Visibility of results across the project
- A discipline for thorough planning and controlled change management
